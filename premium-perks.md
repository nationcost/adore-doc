## FAQ

### How long does premium last?

Premium is typically granted for 30 days per purchase. Contact support for longer durations.

### Can I transfer premium to another server?

### What happens when premium expires?

Your server will revert to free limits. Existing configurations above the free limits will remain but won't trigger until you're back under the limit.
